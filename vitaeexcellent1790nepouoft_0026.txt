DE Cottusstio anorz:

very learned and honourable Per-
son Alexander BeceHus, Chan-
cellor of Verona, made, and the
most illustrious Count Fernand
Nogarola, a Gentlernan as con-
fiderable for his Learning as
Qalsty, communicated to the
famous Laurentius Pignorius‚
from whom I had the favour of
a Sifrht osit; I perceive, (I say)
that Nepos was born tn Hostilia,
which is a Village in the
'l erritory of ἲ erema, mentioned
by Tacitus, Pliny, Caffiodorus‚
and Antoninus in his Itinerart,
and ts at this Day sub} e& to the
Ecclefiastical Ῑυι-ἰίάἰξὶιοη of Ve-
rona. Our Historian is called
by Gellius, Β. 15. ch. 28. an in-
timate Friend of Cicero, and
that he wrote a Chronicle‚ we
have the Testimony of the same
Gellius, Β. 26. chap. 21. And
agreeably to that triple Divifion '
of “sime into Uncertain, Fa-
bulous, and Historical, (of which
I have given an Account out of
Varro and others, in my Treatise
of the Art of writing History)
he seems to have divided it in-
to three Books, and, in each
of these, to have comprised a Nar-
rative of each respecftive Time.
For, that Nepos wrote three
Books, in which he comprehend-
ed the whole Seriesof Time, Ca·-
tullus, in the Beginning of his
Hendecasyllaba, declareso in ex-
press Terms5 and that the histori-
cal Time was not the sole Subje&
of his Chronicle appears pretty
plainly, from this Paffag e in Au-
sonius: I have sent to your High-
mss the Apolo gues of Tition, and
