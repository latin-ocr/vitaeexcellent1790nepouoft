CHABRIAS.

Athenienses diem certam Cha·
briae praestiterunt, quam ante,
domum nifi redisset capitis se
illum damnaturos denuncio-
rnnt. Hoc ine nuncio Athe·
nas rediit, neque ibi diutifiis
est moratus, qulam fuit necesse.
Non enim libenter erat ante
oculos civium suorum, quod
δι’ vivebat laute, δε indulgebat
fibi libemlffis, quixm ut invi·
diam vulgi polset effugere.
Est enim hoc commune vitium
in magnis liberisque civitati-
bus, ut invidia gloriae cornes
fit, ὅτ, libenter de iis detra-
hant, quos eminere videant
altifis: neque animo aequo
pauperes alienam opulentium
intuentur fortunam. Itaque
Chabrias, 'quoad ei licebat,
plurimnm aberat. Neque vero
solus ille aberat Athenis liben—
ter, sed omnes fere principes
fecerunt idem3 quod tannim
se ab invidi& putabant futuros,
quantfim Ξι conspeetu suorum
recessissent. ltaque Conon plu-
rimum Cypri vixit, Iphicrates
in Thracia, Timotheus Leibi,
Chares in Sigaeo. Dissimilis
quidem Chares horum δι fac-
tis & moribus3 sed tamen A·
thenis δε honoratus & potens. .

King. The Atheniamfixed Cha-

brias a certain Day‚ before which
{f he did not return home, they
declared they would condemn him
to die. Upon this llslff}ge he
returned to Athens, nor did he

stay there longer than um m·-

cejffiny. For he was not very·
willingly under the Eyes of his
Countrymen, because he both lived
very honajsomehi, (md indulged
himself more sreely, than that
he could pofl'ibly escape the
Odium of the Vztlgor .· For this

is a common Fault in great ond

free Stateo, that popular Hatred

is the Attcndcwt of Glory3 ani
they willingly take from those
whom they see tower above other
People3 nor do the Poor look
upon the Fortzme aff the IVeal'thy
with cm easy Mind .· Whenfore
Chabrias, os sar os was pffble
for him, was very much away.
Nor was he alone gladly absent

from Athens, but almost all the

great Men did the stmzm because
ihey thought they fhould bequi‘sb

far removed from popular Ha-

tred as they retired from the Sight
of their Countrymen. Where-

fore Conon lived very mnch at

Iphicrates in Thrace,
“Timotheus at Lesbos, Chares in

them indeed, both in his Afflt‘ons
and Manners , but yet he was
both honoured ond powetsul ot
