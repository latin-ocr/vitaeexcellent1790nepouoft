towards him. For cecilius, when
dying, adopted him by his Will,
and made him Heir to * Three.—
Fourths qf his Estate3 by which
Inheritance he got about α hundred
Times a hundred thousand † Sester-
ces. ‘The Sister cys Atticus ‘was mar-
ried to Q Tullius Cicero, and M.
Cicero had made up the Match3
with whom he lived in α very close
F riendfhip from theTime o'f their
being &hoel-fillum, and much
more familiar-ly thanwith Quintus ς
that it may he therebyjudged‚ that
α similitude of Manners does more
in Friendfhip than Affinity. He
was likewise intimate with Q Hor-
tenfiren, who in those Times had the
highest Reputation sor Eloquence,
that it could not he understood
whether of them loved him more,
Cicero or Hortenfius; and he ef-
fitted that which was very dffcult,
that there was no Endeavour to

those, hetwixt whom there was a
Rivalry fer so confiderable a Prize
of Fume3 and he was the Instru-

⁸ Dodrans is nine unciae or Twelfths of the Roman As, which

was originally a large Brass Coin‚ almost an English Pound ; but by
several Reduffions brought at last to one four and twentieth Part of
that Weight. An Estate was likewise termed As, and divided into
twelve Par-ts, called unciae‚ and accordingly haeres ex affl, was Heir
to the whole Eiiate, haeres ex doq'rante was Heir to nine unciae ox·
Twelfth's‚ i. e. Three Fourths of the Estate.

† Sestianus, as Ι have already remarked, is near upon two Pence
of our Money3 Sestertium fignifies a thousand Sestertii: According
to the Roman Way of Reclzoning, after a numeral Adverb is always
to be understood a hundred Thousand3 so that centies LSS. is a
hundred times a hundred Thousand Sesterces‚ or ten Millions‚ i. e.
70‚000 Pounds of our Money nearly. It seems strange the Romans
should use no higher a Denomination‚ than that of a twopenny
Piece, in their Reckoning of Money5 it must have rendered Ac-
counts high, and troublesome enough.
