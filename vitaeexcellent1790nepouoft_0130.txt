CHAP. IV. Chabrias lost his
Lfi’ in the Social b'Var‚ in this·
Manner. ‘The Athenions were
aſjaulting * Chius : Chabrias wax
on board the Fleet without any
Commouet, but he exceeded all thostz
that were in Commzffion, in Au*
thority3 and the Soldiers more
regarded him, than those that
commanded them ,ξ Which Thing
haltened his Deathfor him .· For
whilst he endeavours to enter the
Hac-bour first, and orders the
Master to steer the Ship thither,
he was his own Ruin3 for after
he had made his lVay into it, the
72ss did not follow. Upon which,
being surrounded by a Concourse of
the* Enemy, whilst he fought very
bravely‚ his Ship‚ being strqck
with a † Rostrum, began tofink.
Though he might have escaped from
thence, if he would have thrown
himself into the Sca, because th?
Fleet of the Achenmm was at
hand, to have taken him up as be
swam3 he chosttffrather to pet-ish,
than throwing· away his Arms,
to quit the Ship in which he had

sailed.. Tha rest would not do that,

who came off byswimming. But
he, thinking an honourable Death
better than ascandalous Life, was
staia with the Enomies Inopem,
fighting hand to hand with them.
