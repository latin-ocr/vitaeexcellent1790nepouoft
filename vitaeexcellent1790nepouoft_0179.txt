vaibar, multumque in eo con-
sequi se dicebat, quod Tiss'a-
phernes perjurio suo δε homi-
nes suis rebus abalienaret, δε

’ deos sibi iratos redderet: se

autem, servata religione, cou-
firmare exercitum, quum ani-
madverteret, deorum numen
facere secum, hominesque fibi
conciliari amiciores, quod his
studere coul‘ueli'ent, quos con-
servare fidem viderent.

CAP. ΠΙ. Postquam indu-
ciarum praeteriit dies, bar-
barus non ⁴dubitans, quod
ipfius erant plurima domici-
lia in Caria, &c ea regio his
temporibus multo putabatur
locupletiffima‚ eo potiffimum
hostes impetum fatfturo& om-
nes suas copias eo contraxerat.
At Agesilaus in Phrygiam se
convertit, eamque prius depo-
pulatusest‚ quam Tissaphernes
usquam se moveret. Magna
praeda militibus locupletatis,
Ephesum hyematum exerci-
tum retluxit3 atque ibi, offi-
cinis armorum institutis, mag-
nii industria bellum apparavit.
Et quo studiofius armarentur,
inlignisil'que ornarentur, prte-
mia proposuit, quibus dona-
rentur, quorum egregia in ea
re fuili'et industria. Fecitidem
in exercitationum generibus,
ut qui caeteris praestitiffent‚ eos
magnis afficeret muneribus.
His igitur rebus effecit, ut
ὃς οῑηειῑίιὶὶῐιωηῑ & exercita-
tuiiinum haberet exercitum.
