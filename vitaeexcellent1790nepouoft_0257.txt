T. P. ATTICUS.

pud P. Volumnium, cui, ut
ostendimus paulo ante, opem
tulerat. (Tanta varietas iis
temporibus fuit fortunat, ut
modo hi, modo illi, in sum-
mo ess'ent aut fastigio, aut
periculo.) Habebatque se-
cum Q Gellium Canium,
aequalem‚ fimimmumque sui.
Hoc quoque fit Attici boni-
tatis exemplum, quod cum
eo, quem puerum in ludo
· cognoverat, adeo conjunffle
vixit, ut ad extremam aeta-
tem amicitia eorum creve-
rit. Antonius autem, etfi
tanto odio ferebatur in Ci-
ceronem, ut non solslm ei,
sed omnibus etiam ejus ami-
cis effet inimicus, eosque vel-
let proscribere3 multis hor-
tantibus tamen, Attici memor
fuit officii3 et ci, cum re-
quifisset ubinam effer, sua
manu scripfit, ne timeret, sta-
timque ad se veniret5 se eum,
δε Gellium Canium de pro-
scriptorum numero exemifl'e,
ac, ne quod periculum inci-
deret, quod noem fiebat, prae-
fidium ei mifit. Sic Atticus
in summo timore non solfim

fibi,

ing the * Proscriptiom and ab-
sconded with P. Volumnius, to
whom he had given his Affislonce‚
as I have shown α little above.
(So great was the Variety of For-
tune in those Times, thot one
while those, another while those,
were either in the greatest* Hcight
ofGrandeur, or the greatest Dan-
ger.) And he hod with him Q

Gcllius Canius, equal in Age9 ond

very much like himself. ‘Ibis
likezoist may be another Jtfionce
of Atticm-'s Goodmst, thot lte
lived in Jitch ιι closo Unim with
lu'm, whom he had known when ιι
Boy ot School, that their Frond- ·
ship grew even to their old Age.
Bot Αιιίοιιν, though he was pofhcd
on eaith so great α Raestntm nt,
ασαιι st † Ciceao, thot he was no t
αιι Em emy to him only, but to all
lis Friem-ls, cml im* ιι· sed to pro-
scribe them· ‚ yet, many People
alvifing him to it, he was mini-
szael of Α”ίιιιιις 5 Kindmfi· , and
wh ιι [τι hx i inquirel where he
wa s, wrote to hzm with hl s οιιιιι
Ηιιιιᾶ, that he fhould not sear, and
that he should come to him out of
hond, that he hod taken him, and
Gellius Canius out of the Number

ng of

up of Gentlemens Names in the

most public Parts of Rome, with the promise of a Reward to such
as should bring their Heads. This abominable Butc'nery was fizst
used by Sylla, spoken of above.

† This Cicero was a Person of the highest Abilities in Rome, a
good Philosophex·, and the greatest Master of Eloquence that ever
lived3 which fine Talent cost him his Life: For having exerted itin
several Harangues before the senate against Antony, he so incensed
him, that nothing could satisfy him but the Head of the Speaker,
which he got at last, though Cesar struggled a long Time to
sazve him.
