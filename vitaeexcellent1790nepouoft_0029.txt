quest the same Person wrote the
Li¹ e of Ceto, notwithstanding
hierom mus Manius denies rt in
the 4t h Bo< l< of his Mis scellanies‚
who is sufficientiy confuted by
the very Preface of Nepos. We
have likewise another Proof of
it: For several Paffaoes in the
Book most plainly evince, that it
wsa written at the ‘l ime when
the Power of Pompey and Cesar
was grown to a Height dangerous
to the public Liberty. Lam-
binus has collecfi'ted the Paffages
to that purpose, and thereforeI
need not produce them here.
Nor in his Lives of Illustrious
Nlen did he confine himself to
such alone as excelled in the Mi-
litary Way3 but likewise took
in those that had rendered thern—
selves famous by their Writings‚
as appears from Jerorn’. s Proface
to his Account of the Feci-2 fiasti-
cal KVriters‚ where he reckons
Nepos among the Precedents he
should follow in his Account of
such as had been famous for Wri-
ting. Nepos treated as well of
the Greek as the Latin Authors
As to the Greek, I go upon what
he says in the Life ofDion‚ where
he tells us he had written a Book
of the most considerable Histori-
ans, in which, amongst others, he
had given an Account of Philistus
the Historiam. As to the Latin
Authors, it is manyVVays evident:
For we learn from Suetonius’s
Life of Terence, falsely ascribed
to Donatus, that he had given
an Account ofthat Author. Gel-
lius too quotes the first Book of

the Life of Cicero, in the 2831
