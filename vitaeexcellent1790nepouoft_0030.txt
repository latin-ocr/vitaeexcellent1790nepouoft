DE CORNELIO NEPOTis.

ch. of his 13tl1 Β. And Jerorn‚ ,

vc- in his Epistle to Pammachius,

produces a Quotation from that
VVork. Nay‚ it is likely that the
Life we have of T. Pomponius
Atticus was taken from thence,
as well as that of Cato, which
lie closes with these &Vordsz We
have· given a largcr Account os his
Lg'fe and Bahaviour in that Book
we publzfhcd of him alone, which
thoſs’, that are defit-cus to be more
fully acquainted with> Cato, may
canficlt, ifthey pleast’. He plainly
declares the Reason, why the Ac-
count he there gives of Cato is so
brief, to be his having publissled
his Life by itselfbefore. there-
sore the short Lifle of Cato we have
¹1'5 the Part of a bigger Volume,
wherein were contained the Lives of
And in-
deed the following Words Were
read in a most ancient Book of
Obertus Gifanius before the Life
ofAtticus : From Cornelius Iffepos’f
Bwl: of the Latin PBstorians. ’ He
left behind him likewii'e Books of
Examples, which Gellius quoteS,
B. 7. ch. 18. and Charisius, Β, 1.
The Ancients commend ozher
Works of his too that were not
historical. For Lafihzndus produ-
ces something out ofan Epistle of
his to Cicero, in the 15tl1 Chap.
of the 3d Book of his Divine In-
stitutrons· , as sranquillus, m tlie
55th Chapter of Julius Cesar's
Life, makes mention ofan Epistle
of Cicero’s to Nepos3 as do likess
