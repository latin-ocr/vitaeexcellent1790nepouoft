³* Compare this Paffage with another in the Close of the 16th
Chapter, where our Author, in commending Cicero’s Forefight‚ says,
prudentiam quedammcdo ff divinationem. I am very inclinable to
think that Divinatio here is a false Reading for Divinitas, which is
the only Salvo Ι believe can be found for our Author. Perhaps some
ignorant Person, finding the two Pass'ages something alike‚ has
pretended to corre& the former by the-latter, which Correffion at

Similitude 'oemixt Divinatio in the c-nly Sense it can here have,

mess bet-xixt Divinatio in that Sense, and the unalterable Goodnefs
of Humanity in Atticus, which the Author is here commmding,
and consequently no foundation for such an Application of'the
Vr'ord Divinatim If we read Divinitas, for Divinatic, the Senfe
