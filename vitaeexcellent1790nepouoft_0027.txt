CORNELIO NEPoTc;

¹3
Nepos's Chronicle, as containing
another Set of Apologaes (sor they
are indeed no better than Fables)
as likewise fro what Tertullian
in his Apology against the Gen—-
tiles (when he expressly reckous
him amongst the Writers of An·-
tiquities) says, that he made Sa-
tnrn to be no more than a Man.
Which Account Lafflantius like-
wise gives of him, B. 1. ch. 13.
He left befides the Lives of seve·
ral illustrious Men, which Gel-
lius makes mention of, B. 11.
ch. 8. and Servius on the first
AEneid. Charisius quotes the xst,
15tl1, and 16tl1 Book3 >of these
we have 22 Commanders of Fo-
reign Nations. And that in his
other Bpoks he treated of the
Romani& these words of his in
the latter End of Hannibal’s Life
sufficiently shew: But it is now
Time for us to put cm End to this
Book, and give yon the Lives εἷ
the Roman szmandws, that, by
comparing the Aaions of both, the
Readers may judge which ought
to have the Prefercnce. The
proper Title to this XVork ap-
pears plainly from these con-
cluding &Vords in his Preface:
IVlJerefore we fhall now proceed
to the Execution of our Defign,
ond in this Book give an Account
of the Lives eff the excellent Com-
manders. That he wrote the le-es
of several Kings‚ befides these
commanders, is plain from the
Words following the Life of Ti-
moleon: thst were in a man-
ner all the Greek Commanders
worth our Notice, besules Kings;
fin· we had no Defign of tnecldling
