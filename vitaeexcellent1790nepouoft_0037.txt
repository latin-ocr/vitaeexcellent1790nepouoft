Writings of the Ancients‚ were Answers given in the Temples of

Greeks scarcely ever undertook any Business of Importance‚ without
consulting their Oracle at Delphos, which was famous even in fo·
reign Countries. Delphos was a Town in Achaia, not far from

the Corinthian Bay.

† Lemnus is an Issand in the Noxth Pam of the AEgean Sea.
