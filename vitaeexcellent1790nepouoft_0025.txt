GERARD Vossms’s LIFE
OF
CORNELIUS NEPOS.

ἴξέἕῖξ Ornelius Nepos lived
ἒ C Ξρξ before and under the

ff Diehtorship of Ce-
{※※j} sar, and after it too.
Jerom in Eusebius' s

Chronicle places him under the
fourth Year of Augustus’ s Reign.
Nor shallI much dispute with any
one, that may from thence pre-
tend to infer, that he began at
that Time to publish x'ne V=s0rk8‚
be was afterwards 1ο very famous
for. He lived nigh the Po, as
appears from Pliny, B. 3 ch.18.
For which Reafon he ιε called by
Catullus, in his first Epigram, an
Italian ; and by Ausonius, in his
24th Epissse, a Gaul, because that
Part of Italy beyond the Po was
called Gallia Togata. Elias Vi-
nems, upon the 7th1dyllium of
Ausonius, tells us, he was never
able to make anv Discovery as to
the Place of his Nadvsty. But I
find 111 Leander Albertus’s Ac-
count of Ital*5 that he was a Na-
rive of Verona, as 11 kewife in the
