Thing ef a tolet-able Latin Siste, but this. Constant Cornverybtioru
with a little Help from Grammar, is, in my Judgntent‚ the best and
mest easy Methea af attaining te α ready and proper Ule qs Α any
Fereign Language. For very little can hedone in the Way of Con-
verssstson at School. For to confine the Boys to the Talking os Latin
amongsl themselves, before they know any Thing almast os the Language,
is ridnulous, aad the moll effellual Mean& that could poſjibly be
thought of, to prevent their ever speaking or wriling it, with any
tolerable ExaHness and Propriety: The Speaking of a Language‚ any
ene has learned tospeak pretty well, is the lVay to be fiere to retain it,
as likewiseto nse zt with greater Flueney and Freed07n3 but tha: is
net what we are here enqniring aster, bnt a' nasethod of attaining a
tolerable Propriety in the writing cma'ſjt‘eaking of Latin. ‘I‘his Ι never
yet knew done, sy much as in enefingle Itylance, in any School‚ that
has came jwz‘tlyin the Reach (ff my Knowledge, er indeed any Yhing
like it. Nay, I have talked with very ingenious splen, and good
Jzsdges, beccense Persam os censtderahle Experience in that IVay, who

any Maked that can be taken with them, will be found generally

through seur or five Alabon, in the Mechod of rendering ‘Trans-

vanced to Translaticns of greater Freedom, wherein the Propriety,

strie‘test Regma. ‘This jhs-'ethai of Preceeding is next to Conversa-
