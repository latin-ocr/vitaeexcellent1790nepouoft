When ἦ banished his Country‚ he
prestvzfed two hundred and fifty
thousand † sesterces. But after
the Roman Affizirs were pretty
well stttled, he returned to Rome,
as I think, when L. Cotta (md
L. Torquatus were Corfidi] which
Doy the whole City of the Athe-
m'cms did so obstrve, thot they
discovered by their Tcars their

r Sorrowfhr theirsuture Loss.

These, and the like are the Urbana Officia here spoken of. 1 make
not this Remark to depreciate Mr. Pack's Performance, which is
as good, at least, if not better than any Thing of the Kind I evei·
read3 but to do justice to Cornelius Nepos, and myself 100, who
might otherwise be condemned, upon the Authority of Mr. Pack,
as havin here grossly mistaken the Sense of my Author.

ἕ Ι c ose to render fugienti ex patrici, being baniihed out of his
Country: Major Pack's Transsation‚ being obliged tofly his Country‚
is, to my Thinking, too general to convey the Anthor's Meaning
to such as are unacquainted with Cicero's Story3 he uses the Word

⁸ fugio here, as the Greeks do their verb φεύγω, which is commonly
put for being banilhed, sometimes with the Aecus-anve wari-5533,
but oftener, I think, without.

1 A Sesterce was the fourth Part of a Denarius, which was about
8 d. of our Money 3 the whole Sum therefore here mentioned is near
upon 2000 Pounds. *Δ

† Pietas, -I render, dutiful Behaviour. Piety‚ which is Major
Pack's Transsation of the Wmd, has nothing at all to’do here. See
Note the first, on the first Chapter of Diorx’e‘Lifs,
